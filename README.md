# SUPER SPACEBREAK
Ever wonder why there was a spaceman on the cover of the Atari 2600 game Super Breakout?  Me too.

# Why I Made This

I love the artwork Atari's artists would crank out for the box art of their 2600 games, but it's obviously in contrast to the ridiculously simple presentation of the actual games. My objective with this is to make a game that more accurately represents the image pictured on the front of the box by incorporating either a similar art style, or including elements on the box that don't make an appearance in the game at all.  

I chose [Super Breakout](http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-2600-vcs-super-breakout_7848.html). It's a super simple game, but the box art includes an astronaut that doesn't make an appearance in the game whatsoever. I'm trying to correct that. I hope you find my take as dumb and funny as I do.

# Making the Sausage

I started with the source code of [Phaser.io 3's Breakout Sample Game](https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/games/breakout/breakout), and flipped the game upside down just to see how it might work. 


At this point, the game was largely playable. I moved things around so that level resets would work, added the dumb screen shake that needs to be toned down, added score and balls remaining displays, then grabbed my iPad and drew the background using [Procreate](https://procreate.art/ipad) in like 10 minutes.  It took me longer to get images on and off my iPad than it took to draw that background in case you're wondering -- haha.

I'd done all I could from the couch, and went downstairs to wrap things up. In the final hour, I created the sole sound effect using [sfxr](https://github.com/grimfang4/sfxr), added some found code that helped scale the game up to fill the entire screen, created the title screen, final testing, then uploaded the project to the game jam [itch.io](https://thomw.itch.io/ufo-destruction). 

# Credits

I used fonts from https://atariage.com/2600/archives/AtariFonts/index.html?SystemID=2600 for my fake box art and some of the in-game text.
